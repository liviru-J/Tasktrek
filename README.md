# TaskTrek

TaskTrek is a project management tool inspired by traditional to-do lists, designed to facilitate task tracking and management. It provides users with the ability to categorize tasks into different stages such as "To Do", "Doing", and "Done". This tool is particularly suitable for programmers who want to organize their tasks based on programming languages or projects. Users can add tasks, assign them to specific categories, mark them as completed, and delete tasks as needed.

## Features

- Create tasks and assign them to different categories (e.g., programming languages, projects).
- Track the progress of tasks by categorizing them into "To Do", "Doing", and "Done".
- Easily add new tasks and update their status.
- Delete tasks with a simple click on the delete icon.
